# Ian Orzel's Minijava Compiler Submission

My compiler successfully compiles all 8 of Appel's mini Java programs. The resulting 
programs all execute properly. Only 7/8 of them produce the proper output.The test case 
that does not produce the proper output is `TreeVisitor.java`, which is due to the fact 
that my compiler does not implement dynamic dispatch (always uses static dispatch).

I have included two test cases in my program. The test case `MyTest1.java`, illustrates 
that loops, recursion, arrays, printing, integer expressions, complex if statements, local 
variables, function calls with parameters, and field access are all working as expected. 
The test case `MyTest2.java` illustrates that inheritance (of both methods and fields) and 
records are working as expected.
